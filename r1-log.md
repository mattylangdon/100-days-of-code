## Log

### R1D1 
1. Started using GitHub and linked to Netlify and VS code
2. Pasted demo react app that uses material-ui and will be a good enough starting point to modify https://codesandbox.io/s/pgbwg?file=/index.html
3. Tried to merge code to GitHub via VSC (fail), ended up simply uploading to GitHub instead.
4. Deployed app https://pensive-morse-2de194.netlify.app which does absolutely nothing at all. 

Probably doomed to fail, but will come back and get it going
